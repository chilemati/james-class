Steps to push codes to Github

> git init
> git status
> git add .
> git commit -m "discription"
// it may ask you to login or tell me who you are
> git remote add origin rep.git link
> git branch (note the branch name in green color)
> git push origin yourBranchName

next time you want to push to this repo:
> git status
> git add .
> git commit -m "discription"
> git branch
>git push origin yourBranchName

// if you see a pull request on your Github repo, your file has been uploaded,
// just click your branch name to see your files
